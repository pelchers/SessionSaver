## Longrunning Workflow Convention

For any multi-phase task list (ADR sessions, research, or implementation), always use the
longrunning orchestration loop:

- Launch the **longrunning-session** agent to own the phase plan and validations.
- Use the **orchestrator-session** agent to spawn one subagent per phase.
- Each phase ends with a review file, updates the task list status, and a commit/push.
- The orchestrator “pokes” the next subagent and continues until all phases complete.
