# Commit and Push

Create an atomic commit following project conventions and push to remote.

## Instructions for Claude

When this command is invoked:

1. **Check git status**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Review changes**:
   - Show git diff for all modified files
   - List all untracked files
   - Identify what was changed and why

3. **Create atomic commit**:
   - Stage relevant files: `git add [files]`
   - Write descriptive commit message following conventions:
     ```
     <type>: <subject>

     <body>
