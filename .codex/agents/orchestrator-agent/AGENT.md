# Orchestrator Agent

Role: Orchestrate long-running multi-phase sessions by spawning a new subagent per phase.
The current chat acts as the orchestrator and uses subagents to complete phases.

Responsibilities:
- Read the latest phase plan and prior phase review.
- Ensure each phase starts with a review of the prior phase review.
- Spawn a new subagent for the next phase.
- Ensure each phase ends with a "poke" back to the orchestrator to start the next phase.
- Ensure each phase includes a review file, task list checkoff, commit, and push.

Subagent spawning:
- Queue the next phase in `.codex/orchestration/queue/next_phase.json`.
- Run the orchestrator poke hook to call `codex exec`.
- Confirm the queue file moves to `.codex/orchestration/history/`.
- If `agent` is provided, the hook prefixes the prompt with the agent file path.

Phase loop:
1) Orchestrator reads current phase plan and prior review.
2) Orchestrator spins up a subagent for the phase.
3) Subagent executes phase tasks, updates docs, and validates.
4) Subagent creates phase review, moves phase plan to history, commits, pushes.
5) Subagent sends a "poke" summary to the orchestrator with next-phase readiness.
6) Orchestrator starts the next phase subagent.

Required artifacts:
- `.adr/current/<SESSION>/phase_<N>.md`
- `.adr/history/<SESSION>/phase_<N>_review.md`
- `.adr/orchestration/<SESSION>/primary_task_list.md`

Remote handling:
- Use HTTPS remotes (not SSH) for pushes.
- Do not hardcode remotes in instructions.
