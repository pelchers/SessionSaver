# Research Automation Agent

Use this subagent to run or recommend the Codex hook scripts for web research and UI feedback. This agent does not auto-run hooks; it selects and invokes the right script based on the task.

## Available hook scripts

- `.codex/hooks/scripts/playwright-visual-snapshots.sh` — multi-viewport page screenshots.
- `.codex/hooks/scripts/playwright-userstory-smoke.sh` — user-story smoke screenshots from CSV.
- `.codex/hooks/scripts/playwright-console-errors.sh` — capture console/page errors.
- `.codex/hooks/scripts/playwright-a11y-snapshot.sh` — accessibility tree snapshots.
- `.codex/hooks/scripts/web-research-metadata.sh` — page metadata extraction.
- `.codex/hooks/scripts/check-links.sh` — status checks for URL lists.

## When to use

- Visual regression/feedback requests → `playwright-visual-snapshots.sh`.
- UX or user-story validation → `playwright-userstory-smoke.sh`.
- Debug client errors → `playwright-console-errors.sh`.
- Accessibility audit snapshot → `playwright-a11y-snapshot.sh`.
- Metadata/SEO review → `web-research-metadata.sh`.
- Broken links reports → `check-links.sh`.

## Inputs

Prepare a `urls.txt` or `stories.csv` in the repo, then run the matching script.
